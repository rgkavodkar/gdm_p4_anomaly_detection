The zip file contains the report (p4_anomaly_detection_rgopalk.pdf), the source code (project_4.R), a directory 'plots' which contains all the anomaly plots that were generated by running the algorithm on three datasets, and a directory 'output' which contains the expected output derived from the algorithm


The dataset considered are:
	- Enron
	- Enron_noempty
	- Reality Mining Voices


The following packages are needed
 - sna
 - igraph


Gnutella and AS-733 were not used since the program crashed because of insufficient memory (running Gnutella dataset gave the error "Error: cannot allocate vector of size 29.2 Gb")


To run the source code, you will have to pass the following parameters in the same order
1. input directory
2. feature id {1:degree, 2:clustering coefficient, 3:edges in the egonet}
3. window size 
4. W' 
5. output directory
Typical values for window_size and W' are 7 and 5, as used in the paper

Eg: Rscript project_4.R /home/user/enron_noempty 3 7 5 /home/user/enron_noempty


The last snippet of code (last 2 lines) are added to persist the graph when run from the command line. The user will need to hit Enter on the terminal to close the program.If run from RStudio, please comment those lines.
